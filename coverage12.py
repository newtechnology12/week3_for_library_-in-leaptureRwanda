# Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs.
#  It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed,
#  then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but 
# was not.

# Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of tests. 
# It can show which parts of your code are being exercised by tests, and which 
# are not.
